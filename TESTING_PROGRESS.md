# AI Team Router - Testing & Validation Progress

## Executive Summary
**Status**: Phase 4 - Benchmarking ready with complete memory management
**Started**: 2025-08-12
**Current Phase**: Ready for performance benchmarking

## Testing Plan Overview

### Phase 1: System Prerequisites âœ… COMPLETE
- [x] Verify Ollama installation and service
- [x] Check claimed models are actually installed
- [x] Validate system memory and hardware detection
- [x] Test basic API connectivity

### Phase 2: Core Router Functionality âœ… FIXED
- [x] Task analysis and complexity scoring (WORKING)
- [x] Domain detection accuracy (WORKING)
- [x] Model selection logic (FIXED - aggressive memory settings)
- [x] Memory management and model unloading (FIXED - enhanced with M3 Pro verification)
- [x] API endpoint responses (WORKING with intelligent routing)

### Phase 3: Tool Integration âœ… COMPLETE
- [x] Web search (DuckDuckGo, Tavily, Google, Brave)
- [x] Excel optimizer (VBA/Pandas generation)
- [x] Code executor (Python/JavaScript)
- [x] File analyzer (PDF/Excel)
- [x] Vision analyzer (OCR/images)

### Phase 4: Performance Benchmarking ðŸ“‹ READY
- [ ] Response time measurements
- [ ] Memory usage profiling
- [ ] Success rate analysis
- [ ] Comparison with documented claims

### Phase 5: Real-World Use Cases ðŸ“‹
- [ ] VueJS component generation
- [ ] Laravel API development
- [ ] Excel processing (150k+ rows)
- [ ] Python script generation
- [ ] Documentation tasks

## Critical Issues Fixed
1. âœ… **Memory Management** - Enhanced unloading with M3 Pro verification
2. âœ… **Health Monitoring** - Emergency fallback at >95% memory pressure
3. âœ… **Tool Integration** - All 4 search APIs + Node.js + Python execution
4. âœ… **Intelligent Routing** - Quality hierarchy with edge mode warnings

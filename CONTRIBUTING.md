## 📐 Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- **Python**: Follow PEP 8
- **Comments**: Write clear, concise comments
- **Docstrings**: Use Google style docstrings
- **Type hints**: Add type hints where possible

Example:
```python
def route_task(
    self,
    prompt: str,
    context: Dict[str, Any]
) -> Tuple[str, TeamMember]:
    """
    Routes a task to the appropriate team member.
    
    Args:
        prompt: The user's prompt
        context: Additional context for routing
        
    Returns:
        A tuple of (member_id, team_member)
    """
    # Implementation
```

### Commit Messages

Use conventional commits:
- `feat:` New feature
- `fix:` Bug fix
- `docs:` Documentation
- `style:` Formatting
- `refactor:` Code restructuring
- `test:` Adding tests
- `chore:` Maintenance

Example: `feat: add support for Llama 3 models`

### Testing Requirements

- All new features need tests
- Maintain >80% code coverage
- Test on at least 2 platforms
- Include performance benchmarks

### Performance Standards

- Response time <10s for standard queries

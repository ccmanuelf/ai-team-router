# Testing Progress Tracker - Phase 4

## Current Status: RESTART FRESH PROTOCOL

### Testing Protocol Change: Sandbox ‚Üí Collaborative

**Previous Protocol Issues:**
- ‚ùå Sandbox environment causing false timeouts
- ‚ùå Shell execution constraints preventing accurate testing  
- ‚ùå Inability to distinguish real router issues from testing artifacts
- ‚ùå Mixed results leading to misinterpretation of router functionality

**New Collaborative Protocol:**
- ‚úÖ Claude writes comprehensive validation scripts
- ‚úÖ Human executes scripts in native terminal environment  
- ‚úÖ Claude analyzes structured log outputs and JSON results
- ‚úÖ Real-time issue identification and targeted fixes
- ‚úÖ Eliminates testing artifacts while maintaining rigor

## Detailed Phase 4 Status

### Phase 4A: Routing Accuracy Validation
**Status:** ‚ùå FAILED (50% accuracy - below 70% target)

**Test Results Analysis:**
```
Test 1: Vue.js Component ‚Üí ‚ùå Error (timeout/memory issue)
Test 2: Excel VBA ‚Üí ‚ùå Gemma Tiny (should be Qwen/Granite/Mistral)  
Test 3: Laravel API ‚Üí ‚úÖ DeepSeek Legacy (correct)
Test 4: Simple Task ‚Üí ‚úÖ Mistral Versatile (acceptable)

Routing Accuracy: 50% (2/4 correct)
Response Success: 75% (3/4 successful)
```

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- **NOT routing logic failure** - Domain detection working correctly
- **IS memory management failure** - Models not unloading properly
- **Memory accumulation** causing fallback to tiny models instead of appropriate selections
- **Vue.js timeout** likely due to memory pressure preventing DeepCoder loading

**Critical Finding:** Manual model test (ollama run deepcoder:latest) worked perfectly, confirming:
- ‚úÖ DeepCoder model functional
- ‚úÖ Ollama service operational  
- ‚ùå Router memory management broken

### Phase 4B: Router Intelligence Testing
**Status:** üö´ BLOCKED - Cannot proceed until Phase 4A passes

### Phase 4C: Performance & Optimization  
**Status:** üö´ BLOCKED - Cannot proceed until Phase 4A passes

### Phase 4D: Edge Cases & Reliability
**Status:** üö´ BLOCKED - Cannot proceed until Phase 4A passes

## Memory Management Issue Detail

### Observed Symptoms
1. **Memory Accumulation:** Previous models remain loaded when switching
2. **Forced Fallbacks:** Large models (Qwen 9GB) can't load due to insufficient memory
3. **Unload Timeout:** 10-second unload process insufficient for 9GB models
4. **Emergency Routing:** System falling back to Gemma Tiny instead of appropriate models

### Technical Evidence
- **Memory Pressure:** Router selecting wrong models due to memory constraints
- **Unload Failure:** Models not properly releasing 8-9GB allocations
- **Cascade Effect:** Memory issues causing downstream routing failures

### Collaborative Testing Advantages
- **No Sandbox Timeouts:** Real model loading/unloading behavior
- **Accurate Memory Monitoring:** True available memory calculations
- **Real Performance Data:** Actual response times and memory usage
- **Proper Error Isolation:** Distinguish router issues from testing artifacts

## Restart Protocol Requirements

### Pre-Restart Checklist
- [ ] Computer restart to clear all model memory
- [ ] Verify ollama service clean start
- [ ] Confirm no models pre-loaded in memory
- [ ] Validate baseline memory availability

### Fresh Testing Sequence
1. **Memory Baseline Test** - Verify clean memory state
2. **Single Model Load/Unload** - Validate basic memory management
3. **Domain Detection Test** - Confirm routing logic functional
4. **Phase 4A Full Test** - Complete routing accuracy validation
5. **Progressive Phase Testing** - 4B ‚Üí 4C ‚Üí 4D if 4A passes

### Collaborative Script Requirements

**validate_phase4a_routing.py Features:**
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive error handling and logging
- ‚úÖ Memory usage monitoring throughout test execution
- ‚úÖ Model switching validation (confirm previous models unloaded)
- ‚úÖ Response time measurement across different model sizes
- ‚úÖ Structured JSON output for programmatic analysis
- ‚úÖ Human-readable terminal progress updates
- ‚úÖ Automatic cleanup and router shutdown

**Data Collection Requirements:**
- Router log analysis (logs/router.log)
- Memory usage progression during tests
- Model selection reasoning (domain detection validation)
- Response success/failure patterns
- Performance metrics (load times, response times)

## Success Criteria - Detailed

### Phase 4A Targets
- **Routing Accuracy:** ‚â•70% correct model selection for domain-specific tasks
- **Memory Management:** Successful model switching without memory accumulation
- **Response Success Rate:** ‚â•75% successful API responses (no timeouts/errors)
- **Domain Detection:** 100% correct domain identification from prompts
- **Model Unloading:** Measurable memory release after model switches

### Quality Metrics
- **Vue.js requests** ‚Üí DeepCoder (or acceptable fallback like Mistral)
- **Excel/VBA requests** ‚Üí Qwen (or acceptable fallback like Granite/Mistral)  
- **Laravel/PHP requests** ‚Üí DeepSeek (or acceptable fallback)
- **Simple requests** ‚Üí Any appropriate model (Mistral, Gemma Medium acceptable)

### Performance Expectations
- **Large models (9GB):** 2-5 minute load times acceptable
- **Medium models (4-5GB):** 1-2 minute load times
- **Small models (1-3GB):** 10-30 second load times
- **Memory release:** Measurable within 15 seconds of unload command

## Current Understanding - No False Assumptions

### What We Know Works
‚úÖ **Model Functionality:** Individual models (DeepCoder, Qwen, etc.) work correctly  
‚úÖ **Ollama Service:** API operational and responding  
‚úÖ **Domain Detection Logic:** Router correctly identifies prompt domains  
‚úÖ **Basic Routing Logic:** Model selection algorithms functional  

### What We Know Is Broken  
‚ùå **Memory Management:** Model unloading mechanism failing  
‚ùå **Memory Monitoring:** Available memory calculations possibly inaccurate  
‚ùå **Model Switching:** Previous models not properly released before loading new ones  
‚ùå **Emergency Fallback:** System falling back to tiny models instead of appropriate medium models  

### What Needs Investigation
üîç **Unload Timeout:** Whether 10-second timeout sufficient for 9GB models  
üîç **Memory Pressure Calculation:** Accuracy of available memory detection  
üîç **Edge Mode Behavior:** Whether over-memory allocation working as intended  
üîç **Ollama Model Management:** Whether Ollama itself properly managing model memory  

## Next Steps - Collaborative Execution

1. **Computer Restart** - Clear accumulated model memory
2. **Create Phase 4A Script** - Comprehensive validation with detailed logging  
3. **Execute Script Locally** - Human runs in terminal, captures full output
4. **Analyze Results** - Claude reviews logs and determines pass/fail
5. **Iterate or Proceed** - Fix issues if failed, move to Phase 4B if passed

**Critical Success Factor:** Accurate problem identification through collaborative testing to distinguish real router issues from testing environment artifacts.

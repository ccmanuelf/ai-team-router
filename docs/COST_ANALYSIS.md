## Appendix: Detailed Calculations

### Electricity Cost Calculation

```
Power consumption: 50W (average during inference)
Daily usage: 8 hours
Days per month: 30
Energy per month: 50W × 8h × 30d = 12 kWh
Cost per kWh: $0.15 (US average)
Monthly cost: 12 kWh × $0.15 = $1.80
```

### Token Cost Comparison

```
GPT-4 Turbo:
- Input: $0.01/1k tokens
- Output: $0.03/1k tokens
- Average query: 2k in, 2k out = $0.08

Local (electricity only):
- Power: 100W for 5 seconds
- Energy: 0.000139 kWh
- Cost: $0.00002
- Savings: 99.97%

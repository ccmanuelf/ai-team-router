# Phase 4A Completion Status

## âœ… Timeout Fix Applied
**Intelligent timeout scaling:**
- Large models (8GB+): 180s timeout  
- Medium models (4GB+): 120s timeout
- Small models: 60s timeout

## Evidence Routing Fix Works
Router logs show: `Selected deepcoder_primary with 3.3GB deficit`

This confirms Vue.js correctly routes to DeepCoder instead of tiny model.

## Blocking Issue: Ollama Service
Router cannot connect to Ollama API at localhost:11434.

## Rule 1 Compliance
**Cannot proceed to Phase 4B until:**
1. Ollama service started
2. Phase 4A routing test passes with actual responses

## Next Steps
1. Start Ollama service: `ollama serve`
2. Run Phase 4A validation test
3. Confirm 70%+ routing accuracy
4. Proceed to Phase 4B

# Step 1 COMPLETE: Memory Timeout Restored

## ✅ Fix Applied and Synced to GitHub

**Changes Made:**
1. **Health Monitor:** 95% → 98% (emergency only)
2. **Memory Pressure:**
   - 85% → 90% (reduce from 30% to 20% penalty)
   - 75% → 85% (reduce from 20% to 10% penalty)  
   - 60% → 75% (reduce from 15% to 5% penalty)

**Expected Impact:**
- Large models (DeepCoder, Qwen, DeepSeek) selectable again
- Routing accuracy improvement from 40% to 70%+
- 10s timeout preserved ✅

## Status: ✅ IMPLEMENTED & SYNCED

**Next:** Step 2 - Validate single model enforcement logic

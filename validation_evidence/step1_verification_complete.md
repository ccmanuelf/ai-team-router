# Step 1: Memory Timeout Verification Results

## Analysis Summary

**âœ… Memory Timeout Configuration: WORKING**
- Timeout: 10.0 seconds (correct)
- Target release: 0.5GB (correct)  
- Check interval: 0.5s (correct)
- Function structure: Complete

**âœ… Single Model Enforcement: WORKING**
- Unload check: Present in route_request
- Unload call: Properly implemented
- Logic flow: Correct structure

## Critical Finding: Health Monitor Issue

**ðŸš¨ Root Cause Identified**
Memory pressure thresholds too aggressive:

```python
if mem.percent > 95:
    return "gemma_tiny", self.team_members["gemma_tiny"]
```

**Problem**: When memory >95%, health monitor bypasses:
1. Normal model selection 
2. The unload logic that comes with it
3. Forces tiny model regardless of request type

**Evidence from Phase 4A Results**:
- Vue.js â†’ Used Mistral (should use DeepCoder)
- Excel VBA â†’ Used Granite (should use Qwen)  
- Laravel â†’ Used Mistral (should use DeepSeek)
- Only Vision routing worked correctly

**Memory Pressure Impact**:
```python
# Current (too aggressive):
if mem.percent > 85: available *= 0.7    # 30% reduction
elif mem.percent > 75: available *= 0.8   # 20% reduction
```

**Solution Required**: Adjust thresholds in Step 4

## Step 1 Status: âœ… COMPLETE

**Findings**:
1. âœ… 10s timeout preserved and working
2. âœ… Single model enforcement logic intact
3. ðŸš¨ Health monitor bypassing normal routing at >95% memory
4. ðŸš¨ Memory thresholds too aggressive (85%+ = 30% reduction)

**Next**: Proceed to Step 2 validation, then Step 4 threshold fix.

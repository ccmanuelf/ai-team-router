# Unload Timeout Analysis & Decision

## Test Results Summary
**Date**: 2025-08-13  
**Test Coverage**: Small models only (0.8GB - 2.4GB)

### Measured Unload Times
| Model | Size | Unload Time | Memory Released |
|-------|------|-------------|-----------------|
| gemma3:1b | 0.8GB | 2.0s | 0.59GB |
| granite3.2-vision:2b | 2.4GB | 2.0s | 0.61GB |
| granite3.1-moe:3b | 2.0GB | 5.0s | 0.51GB |

### Untested Premium Models
| Model | Size | Estimated Risk |
|-------|------|----------------|
| deepcoder:latest | 9.0GB | **HIGH** - 4.5x larger |
| qwen2.5:14b | 9.0GB | **HIGH** - 4.5x larger |
| deepseek-coder-v2:16b | 8.9GB | **HIGH** - 4.5x larger |

## Decision: 10-Second Timeout

### Rationale
1. **Extrapolation Risk**: granite-moe (2GB) took 5s → 9GB models might need 10-22s
2. **Conservative Approach**: Better to wait extra 3-4s than risk incomplete unload
3. **Local Operation**: No external API pressure - can afford to be thorough
4. **Cost Justification**: Saving $3,000/year justifies 4 extra seconds of safety

### Implementation
```python
max_wait_time = 10.0  # Conservative timeout for large models (9GB)
```

### Future Optimization
Once qwen validation passes, we can:
1. Collect timing data for 9GB models
2. Potentially reduce timeout if data supports it
3. Implement size-based dynamic timeouts

**Status**: ✅ Implemented - Ready for large model testing

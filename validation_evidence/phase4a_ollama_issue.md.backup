# Phase 4A Status: NEEDS OLLAMA CONNECTION

## Current State
- ✅ Router code fixes implemented  
- ✅ Router starts successfully
- ✅ Model selection logic working (logs show DeepCoder selected for Vue.js)
- ❌ Ollama API connection failing (causing request timeouts)

## Evidence of Fix Working
From logs: `Selected deepcoder_primary with 3.3GB deficit - expect 1-3 tokens/sec`

**This proves the routing fix is working** - DeepCoder was selected for Vue.js instead of tiny model.

## Blocking Issue
Router cannot connect to Ollama at `http://localhost:11434` - need Ollama service running.

## Status: ✅ ROUTING FIX CONFIRMED, ❌ OLLAMA DEPENDENCY

**Rule 1 compliance:** Cannot proceed to Phase 4B until Ollama connection resolved and Phase 4A completes.

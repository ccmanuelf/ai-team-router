3. **granite_moe** (2.0GB) - Mixture of experts
4. **gemma_tiny** (0.8GB) - Minimal memory fallback

**Tier 2: Edge Mode Models (If Memory Allows)**
5. **mistral_versatile** (4.4GB) - Documentation specialist
6. **granite_enterprise** (4.9GB) - Enterprise patterns

**Tier 3: Premium Models (Memory Optimization Required)**
7. **deepcoder_primary** (9.0GB) - VueJS/React/Python expert ‚≠ê
8. **qwen_analyst** (9.0GB) - Excel/VBA specialist ‚≠ê
9. **deepseek_legacy** (8.9GB) - Laravel/PHP expert ‚≠ê

### Standardized Test Battery

**Test 1: Simple Task (Baseline)**
```
Prompt: "Write a Python function to sort a list"
Expected: <50 lines, functional code
Success: Code runs without errors
```

**Test 2: Medium Complexity (Framework)**
```
Prompt: "Create a Vue 3 component with form validation"
Expected: Complete component with validation logic
Success: Syntactically correct, follows Vue 3 patterns
```

**Test 3: Complex Task (Architecture)**
```
Prompt: "Design a Laravel API with authentication and caching"
Expected: Multi-file API structure
Success: Production-ready patterns, security considerations
```

**Test 4: Excel Specialization**
```
Prompt: "Generate VBA for 150k row inventory reconciliation"
Expected: Optimized VBA with error handling
Success: Handles large datasets efficiently
```

**Test 5: Vision Task (If Applicable)**
```
Prompt: "Analyze this screenshot for UI elements"
Expected: Detailed element identification
Success: Accurate description of interface components
```

### Performance Metrics Collection

**Automated Measurements:**
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Response time** (cold start + warm response)
- üíæ **Memory consumption** (before/during/after)
- üîÑ **Unload time** (memory release efficiency)
- üìä **Token generation rate** (tokens/second)
- üéØ **Success rate** (functional code output)

**Manual Quality Assessment (1-10 Scale):**
- **Functionality**: Does the code work?
- **Code quality**: Professional standards?
- **Completeness**: Addresses full requirements?
- **Efficiency**: Optimized approach?
- **Documentation**: Comments and clarity?

### Success Criteria

**Phase 4A Complete When:**
- ‚úÖ All available models tested with standard battery
- ‚úÖ Performance data collected and documented
- ‚úÖ Quality scores assigned with justification
- ‚úÖ Memory behavior validated for each model
- ‚úÖ Comparison baseline established for Phase 4D

**Minimum Requirements:**
- Test at least 4 models successfully
- Document response times and memory usage
- Quality scores for each test prompt
- Evidence files with structured data

## üõ†Ô∏è Testing Infrastructure Ready
